# Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Improved  Wildfire Detection and Aerosol Identification Using Active Satellite Imagery 
Wildfires rank among the most prevalent natural 
disasters globally and have emerged as a significant factor in climate 
change over the past decade. Early detection of wildfires and smoke 
plumes through satellite imagery is crucial since they are not easily 
extinguishable which may lead to catastrophic consequences for both 
wildlife and forest ecosystems. Classic deep-learning models for 
wildfire and aerosol identification have shown significant progress, 
but high false-positive rates remain a key limitation. This paper 
proposes a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
model that aims to improve the identification of wildfires and aerosols, 
leveraging satellite imagery categorized into cloud, dust, haze, land, 
seaside, and smoke. Moreover, we considered popular deep learning 
and transfer learning models, specifically EfficientNet, MobileNetV3, 
and Inception V3, to identify and distinguish smoke plumes. Hyper
parameter tuning has been performed to achieve more accurate 
results. The metrics evaluated in this research are accuracy, precision, 
recall, and f1-score. A comprehensive analysis was performed that 
aimed to identify the best transfer learning model and the model that 
closely aligns with the performance of the CNN built. This paper 
provides valuable insights into the potential use of transfer learning 
models and of the proposed custom-designed CNN model in early 
wildfire detection by identifying the smoke plumes and helping in 
reducing false fire alarms.
